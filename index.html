                    <br>
                    There are several scheduling algorithms for CPU process scheduling, recalling some
                    of them are shortest job first (SJF) and shortest remaining time first (SRTF). Both
                    of these algorithms must have information about the burst time of the processes
                    in the ready queue. The burst time cannot be determined exactly so estimation
                    comes over here, to execute these algorithms requires the burst time of
                    processes. Research aimed to find out the execution time of the upcoming process before its execution based on it's history.
